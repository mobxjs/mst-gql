## 0.9.0 / 0.10.0

- Enum's no longer get Model added to their name. This is a small breaking change from 0.8.0.

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**

mst-gql now generates model names matching JS conventions by default. If you are upgrading from a pre-0.8.0 release this may result in different names being geneated when you scaffold. If you don't wish to update your names or want to wait, use the new `--dontRenameModels` option to keep your current model names.

- Allow LIST to be optional in TS. [174](https://github.com/mobxjs/mst-gql/pull/174) - [Aryk](https://github.com/Aryk)

- Better error handling around reserved model names. [192](https://github.com/mobxjs/mst-gql/pull/192) - [Matth10](https://github.com/Matth10)
- Remove example project `yarn.lock` files to reduce the "github auto PR" noise.

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**

mst-gql now generates model names matching JS conventions by default. If you are upgrading from a pre-0.8.0 release this may result in different names being geneated when you scaffold. If you don't wish to update your names or want to wait, use the new `--dontRenameModels` option to keep your current model names.
